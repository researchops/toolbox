# ResearchOps Toolbox

This is a community-based project focused on creating and maintaining a resource for researchers and research operations specialists that will empower people to find out not only what tools are being used, but also in which industry, by what size of teams, and where in the world.

Our hope is that this will help researchers and ReOps specialists with tool audits, comparative analyses, and the evaluation and justification of specific research tools. Ultimately, we want to make the tool evaluation and selection process easier and save hundreds of hours for researchers, ReOps specialists, and those who support research.

This is made by researchers & ReOps-ers, for researchers & ReOps-ers. This is a grassroots volunteer effort with no product sponsorship or affiliation. 

We are continuously collecting data and improving the toolbox. 

If youâ€™d like to contribute to the census and tell us about what tools you and your team use, please fill out our census questionnaire (URL: https://airtable.com/shrvxQGZsmwjZEK41 )

If you have any feedback, you can fill out a feedback form or reach out to us at tools.census@researchops.community

## What we have

- A snappy front-end framework [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Deployment on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
    


## Quick start

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
